                    <p>Hello, and welcome to my page! Here youâ€™ll be able to see my own take on the digital portfolio. With sites like LinkedIn making it easy to create a boring, cookie cutter, profile page, I thought it would be much nicer to design one myself! </p>
                    <p>As for me, my name is Soren (hopefully made clear already), and Iâ€™m currently a Software Engineer for Cisco working on the Enterprise Cloud Networking team to enhance the security of network controllers. Just before I took the job, I graduated from Santa Clara University with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering, and through my degree, I acquired key skills to thrive as a developer. While Iâ€™ve spent a lot of my time involved in cyber security, I am currently pursuing all things AI/ML. Iâ€™ve become obsessed with various forms of image and audio classification, and I see the breadth of this field as one large ocean into which I canâ€™t help but dive deep. In my free time, I love to surf, play the guitar, free dive, spearfish, and hike out in nature! I hope to one day connect my work as a developer to something meaningful that helps the planet. ðŸŒ²</p>
